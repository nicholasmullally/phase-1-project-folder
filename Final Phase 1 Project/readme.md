Project Requirements with Developer's Comments:

1) Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

Comments: I am using a free public API that allows the user to view images of cats in the browser. 

2) Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Comments: There is only one HTML file, which is phase-1-project.html. 

3) Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

Comment: The event listeners are: (1) DOMContentLoaded, (2) click, and (3) submit. 

4) Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Comments: The user is able to email the developer. The user is able to play a video related to cats. 

5) Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

Comment: I have tried to keep the code as DRY as possible.
